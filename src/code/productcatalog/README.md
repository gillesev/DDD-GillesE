### Product Catalog Sub System
productcatalog: responsible for maintaining which product is active when, prices (it could be a separate domain but this is a simplified model), and product content (again this could be its own domain)
- activate/terminate a product (merchant team actor)
- maintain product pricing (pricing team actor)
- maintain product content management (content mgmt team actor)

This domain has not been fleshed out as not central to the E-Commerce scenarios illustarted by this POC exercise.
